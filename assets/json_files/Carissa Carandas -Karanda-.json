    "Information": "Aloe vera is a medicinal plant with antioxidant and antibacterial properties. Aloe vera benefits can include reducing dental plaque, accelerating wound healing, preventing wrinkles, and managing blood sugar. Aloe vera, or Aloe barbadensis, is a thick, short-stemmed plant that stores water in its leaves."
 ,"Procedure":"Cleaning: Wash the leaves thoroughly under running water to remove any dirt, dust, or impurities.\n\nPreparation:Crush or grind the Karanda leaves to extract their juice. You can use a mortar and pestle or a blender for this purpose.\n\nAlternatively, you can boil the leaves in water to prepare a decoction. Boil a handful of fresh Karanda leaves in water until the water reduces to about half its original volume.\n\nStraining: If you prepared a juice, strain the crushed leaves to separate the juice from any solid particles. If you made a decoction, strain the liquid to remove the leaves.\n\nThe juice or decoction may be consumed to alleviate digestive issues, boost immunity, and promote overall well-being.\n\nIn Ayurveda, Karanda leaves are considered to be part of a holistic approach to health and wellness. They are valued for their ability to support various bodily functions and promote overall vitality."
